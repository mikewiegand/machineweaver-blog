**Why now?** After three years building AI-assisted code systems (OTAJet, PackWeave, LangGraph nodes on Thor), it’s time to publish field notes.

**What to expect**
- End-to-end designs (ESP32 OTA, ring rollouts, signed manifests).
- AI codegen workflows (prompt packs, evals, LangGraph state machines).
- Tooling that actually ships (scripts, checklists, diagrams).
- Much more coming soon...
